# Module-2-Sample-Portfolio

## Description
  
I built this project as a Smart portfolio that can house prior projects, contact information, and more information about myself that would be sent to a recruiter or potential future employer. By making this project I get to work on my skills as a programmer and highlight prior projects I have worked on, while creating a useful tool to give to recruiters. In the process of making this project I learned that there are many different ways to do the same things in CSS(i.e. examples where grid would be more useful than flexbox) and how important it is to compartmentalize your project and properly document your code.
